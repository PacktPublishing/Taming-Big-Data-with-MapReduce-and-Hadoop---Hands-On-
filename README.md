## About the Video Course
Big Data processing is creating a lot of buzz in the market lately, with organizations having to deal with large amounts of data on a daily basis. Processing such data and extracting actionable insights from it is a major challenge; that’s where Hadoop and MapReduce comes to the rescue. This course will teach you how to use MapReduce for Big Data processing – with lots of practical examples and use-cases. You will start with understanding the Hadoop ecosystem and the basics of MapReduce. You will proceed to see how MapReduce can be used to process different types of data – whether it is analyzing movie ratings or your social network data. You will also learn how to run MapReduce jobs on Hadoop clusters using Amazon Elastic MapReduce. The course wraps up with an overview of other Hadoop-based technologies such as Hive, Pig, and the in-demand Apache Spark.
